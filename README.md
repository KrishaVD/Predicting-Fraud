# Predicting-Fraud

Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

In this post, we will walk through the process of building several machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions. We will use a dataset that contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. 

# Loading the Data

First, we load our dataset, which is stored in a CSV file named 'creditcard.csv'. We use pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, to load our dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Before we start building models, it's important to understand our data. We check for missing values and get a sense of the distribution of normal and fraudulent transactions.
```python
print(data.isnull().sum())
print(data['Class'].value_counts())
```
Preparing the Data: We split our data into features (X) and the target variable (y). The 'Class' column, which indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent, is our target variable.
```python
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']
```
We then split our data into a training set and a test set. We will train our models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the test set.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

# Building Models
We will build several models and compare their performance. The models we will build are:
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	Random Forest
3.	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4.	XGBoost
5.	Neural Networks
6.	Isolation Forest
Here's an example of how to build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
# Create a Logistic Regression model
log_reg = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
# Train the model
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
# Use the model to make predictions on the test data
y_pred = log_reg.predict(X_test)
# Print a classification report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
The rest of the code will be available in another file, We follow a similar process for the other models, adjusting the code as necessary for each model.

# Evaluating Models
To evaluate our models, we look at the precision, recall, and f1-score for each model. These metrics give us a sense of how well our model is performing. In our case, we found that the XGBoost model performed the best.

# Conclusion

In this post, we walked through the process of building and evaluating several machine learning models for fraud detection. We found that the XGBoost model performed the best on our dataset. However, the best model can vary depending on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. It's always a good idea to try multiple models and choose the one that best suits your needs.
